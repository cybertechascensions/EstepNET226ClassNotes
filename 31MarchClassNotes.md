# Class Notes For 31 March
  - Setup Github Note Repository and added it to the class repo
    1. Have to make the repo on github.com and then in the CLI, do the commands:
       - git clone {url of the repo}
       - cd {directory of the repo}
       - git init
       - echo "# Class Notes" > 31MarchClassNotes.md
       - git add 31MarchClassNotes.md
